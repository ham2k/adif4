Test 5 for Character Encoding support: QSO with UTF characters, character counts and "tight" fields.

The name and QTH fields use basic latin alphabet extended characters, encoded as UTF-8.
Counts are in characters.

In this case, the fields with UTF characters are quickly followed by required fields.

Apps that open this as 8-bit encoding will read less data than expected
and miss the last two letters of the name and QTH fields.
