Test 2 for Character Encoding support: QSO with UTF characters and byte counts.

The name and QTH fields use basic latin alphabet extended characters, encoded as UTF-8.
Counts are in bytes.

Apps that open this as UTF and count in characters will read more data than expected.
But since there is a 2-byte line break before the next field, it might not be a problem.
