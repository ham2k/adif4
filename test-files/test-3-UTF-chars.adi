Test 3 for Character Encoding support: QSO with UTF characters and character counts.

The name and QTH fields use basic latin alphabet extended characters, encoded as UTF-8.
Counts are in characters.

Apps that open this as 8-bit encoding will read less data than expected
and miss the last two letters of the name and QTH fields.
