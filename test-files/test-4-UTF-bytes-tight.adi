Test 4 for Character Encoding support: QSO with UTF characters, byte counts and "tight" fields.

The name and QTH fields use basic latin alphabet extended characters, encoded as UTF-8.
Counts are in bytes.

In this case, the fields with UTF characters are quickly followed by required fields.

If the app opens this as UTF and counts in characters, it will read more data than expected.

Since there is only one extra byte (a space) between fields, miscounting the size
means skipping the next field and missing required data like call and mode.
